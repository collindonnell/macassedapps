## Mac-Assed Mac Apps?
The phrase "Mac-assed Mac app" is one I coined to describe apps whose design choices emphasize above all to be a **Mac** app. There's no one thing that makes an app Mac-assed. It's like what Paul Volker said about pornography: *you know it when you see it.*

They're probably not cross platform, but some [might](https://1password.com) [be](https://www.git-tower.com/mac) be. They might use the provided widgets, or they might do [something of their own](https://nova.app).

There's so many apps, I can't possibly keep track of them all. For now, please either create a pull request or an issue (with a link) on this repo.
